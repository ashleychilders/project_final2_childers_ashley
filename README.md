**Comments**

1.) We spoke in class about the error in my css for "background-image" being duplicated on my button gradients.

2.) With my style prototype I wanted to incorporate somewhat realistic text elements to the restaurant to get a better look and feel for how the content will work.

3.) I incorporated colors through borders and backgrounds in content sections on my site.  

4.) I felt so much more comfortable building a responsive site as opposed to converting a site to responsive (last assignment). Media-queries are new to me, just learning about them in this course but I think I am getting the hang of it.
